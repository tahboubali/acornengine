Minimal [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx/) "hello world" example.

This doesn't use the [bgfx example framework](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx/tree/master/examples/common). [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) is used for windowing. There are separate single and multithreaded examples.

[Premake 5](https://premake.github.io/) is used instead of [GENie](https://github.com/bkaradzic/GENie), so this also serves as an example of how to build [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx/), [bimg](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bimg/) and [bx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bx/) with a different build system.
